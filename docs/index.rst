Welcome to PyLongslit's documentation!
======================================


.. note::
   
   UNDER CONSTRUCTION

PyLongslit is simple Python software for reduction of astronomical long-slit spectra.
As for now, the software is tested and designed to work with data from 
`ALFOSC <https://www.not.iac.es/instruments/alfosc/>`_ at the
Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), but adaptions to other instruments should be 
possible - feel free to fork the repository and make your own changes.

PyLongslit is a work in progress, and the execution of the software is highly
manual. 

In this documentation, we provide guidance on installation and a tutorial
that will guide you through a reduction of a long-slit spectrum.
