# PyLongslit notebook version

This is a notebook-friendly version of [PyLongslit](https://github.com/KostasValeckas/PyLongslit).

PyLongslit is simple Python software for reduction of astronomical long-slit spectra.
As for now, the software is tested and designed to work with data from 
[ALFOSC](https://www.not.iac.es/instruments/alfosc/) at the
Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT), but adaptions to other instruments should be 
possible - feel free to fork the repository and make your own changes.

The software is based on Johan Fynbo's [PyLongslit](https://github.com/jfynbo/PyLongslit) and Kasper Heintz's [PyReduc](https://github.com/keheintz/PyReduc).

# To get started:


1. Download/clone the whole repository. 
2. Open the `PyLongslit_notebook.ipynb` and follow the instructions in 
the notebook.
